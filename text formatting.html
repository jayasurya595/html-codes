		  <h1> Html text formatting class by gautam majumder  </h1><hr>
		  <p>in this html program we learnt about bold and italic and stong and emphasizing of the text and underlining and deleting the text subscript and super script<br></p><hr>
		  <h2> how to make the text in bold </h2>
		  to make text in bold use &lt;b &gt; tag<br>
		  what ever may be the text written between these b tags becomes bold<br> 
          example:<b> the text in bold is my name that is jayasurya </b><br>		  
          we can also make the text in bold by using strong tag<br>
		  but strong is used when some words to be shown in bold for entire parageagh to be shown in bold we use b tag<br>
		  let us see a sample of this <strong>jayasurya is strong<strong>
		  </p><hr>
		  <p>
		  <h2>how to make the text in italic</h2>
          to make the text in italic place the text between &lt;i&gt; tags<br>
           let us see an example for this <i>   iam very much busy  in learning html coding so please dont disturb me </i><br>		  
		  </p><hr>
		  <p>
		  <h2>how to make the text in italic</h2><br>
		  we can also make the text in the font of italic using &lt;i&gt; tags and using &lt;em &gt; tags<br>
		  let us see a example <i>my name is jayasurya</i><br>
		  and <em> my age is 17</em><br>
		  in the examples the first is done by using &lt;i&gt; tags and second is done using &lt;em&gt; tags but both of them produce same italic <br>
		  but we use i tags to make entire paragraph into italic but we use em tags to to make a word or sentence to be in italic
		  </p><hr>
		  <p>
		  <h2>how to make the text smaller than the regular font size</h2><br>
		  for this we use this html &lt;small&gt; element what ever the text placed between these small tags the text is printed in smaller size than regular font size <br>
		  let us see an example : <small>my father name is sri ram</small> in the above text "my father name is sri ram" is printed in smaller size that is we used small element<br>
		  </p><hr>
		  <p><h2>how to highlight a text in web page</h2><br>
		  to make the text highlighted we use html  &lt;mark&gt; element whatever may be the text placed in mark elemnt gets highlighted by default colour of highlighting is yellow<br>
		  let us see an example <mark>"my name is jayasurya and i from india"</mark> the text which get highlighted is placed between mark opening and closing tags<br>
		  </p><hr>
		  <p><h2>how to delete or strike the text which we have written wrong in an web page</h2><br>
		  for this we use html &lt;del&gt;element  the text which is placed between del opening and closing tags gets striked out <br>
		   let us see an example for this <del> oh god i have written some thing wrong </del> <br>
		   the text that is "oh god i have written some thing wrong"  placed between del opening and closing tags  is striken out<br>
		  </p><hr>
		  <p>
		  <h2>how to underline a text in  an web page</h2>
		  for this we use  html &lt;ins&gt;element the text which is placed between ins  opening and closing tags gets underlined
		  let us see an example for this <ins> this text need to be underlined </ins>
		  </p><hr>
		  <p>
		  <h2> in web page how can we use subcript and super script formats<h2><br>
		  <h3>subscript<h3><br>
		  for this we use html &lt;sub&gt;element and the text which is placed between sub opening and closing elememts is wriiten in subscript 
		  let us see an example for this a<sub>0</sub><br> 
		  let us see another example for this a<sub> <small>0</small></sub><br>
		  in the first example we see that 0 written in subscript is bigger in size so it leads to confusion whether it is written in subscript or written beside<br>
		  in the second example we used small tag between sub script tags like this "a &lt;sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;0 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;<br>
		  </p><hr>
		  <p><h3>super script</h3></p><br>
		  for this we use html &lt;sup&gt;element and the text which is placed between sup opening and closing elememts is wriiten in superscript
		  let us see an example for this a<sup>2</sup><br>
		  let us see another an example for this a<sup><small>2</small></sup><br>
		  in the first example we see that 2 written in super script is bigger in size so it leads to confusion whether it is written in superscript or written beside<br>
		  in the second example we used small tag between sup script tags like this "a &lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;2 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;<br><hr>
