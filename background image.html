   <p> 
   we can see that as the size of the image is less than the size of the background image on the screen it is copied so many times so that it can be displayed on the <br>
   background image
   if we use "background-repeat:noepeat"then the picture copied so many times to cover the screen as to appear as background image gets diminished <br>
   or displayed as a normal image <br>
   if the size of the image is less than the size of image that is suitable to appear as background image then use background-size:cover which instead of copying image multiple<br> times makes the size of the small image as big image which is suitable to background image
