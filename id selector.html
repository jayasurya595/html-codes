<!-- name selector allow us the option of code reusebility by avoiding writing style attribute in the opening tag of an element for which we want to do styling but the problem is 
all the elements having same name are styled rather than the one we want to style to overcome this we came across id selector using id selector 
the one element which we want to style gets styled # is very much important for for defining an id selector-->
